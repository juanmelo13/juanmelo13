Hello there! My name is Juan Melo, I am a student at the University of South Florida :metal: majoring in Computer Engineering!

I enjoy programming in C, C++, Java, Python, as well as in HDL such as Verilog and VHDL.
My main objective is to gather professional experience through an internship or a CO/OP,
however, I am also looking forward to contribute to open source projects here at GitHub.

I hope to start a collection of the projects I develop, and turn it into a full portafolio to show my programming skills.
