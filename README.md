Hello there! My name is Juan Melo, I am a software engineer at Snap Inc. the company behind Snapchat ðŸ‘». I graduated from the University of South Florida :metal: with a B.S. in Computer Engineering!

I enjoy programming in Go, C, C++, Java, Python, as well as in HDL such as Verilog and VHDL.
My mission is to use engineering to make the world a better place.
I am also looking forward to contribute to open source projects here at GitHub.

In this github I host a variety of projects I have developed, in the hopes to show my programming skills.
